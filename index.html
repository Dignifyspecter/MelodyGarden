        <h1>Welcome to My Melody Garden</h1>
        <p>Dear Omarni May,</p>
        <p>This garden was planted with songs, colors, and dreams... all inspired by you.</p>
        <p>Every flower in this melody blooms because of how I feel when I see you smile.</p>
        <p>I like youâ€”more than words can explain. This is my way of saying it.</p>
        <p>â€” From someone who thinks you're the most beautiful note in the song of life.</p>
